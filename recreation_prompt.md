# Prompt to Recreate the Modern Markdown Editor

Here is a detailed prompt that can be used to generate the final, working version of this markdown editor application.

---

### **Your Task**

Create a modern, standalone desktop markdown editor using Python and the standard `tkinter` library. The application should be contained within a single Python file (`main.py`) and should not have any external dependencies for its core functionality.

### **Technical Specifications**

1.  **Language & Framework:**
    *   Use **Python 3**.
    *   Use the built-in **`tkinter`** library for the entire user interface.

2.  **Preview Pane Implementation (Crucial Detail):**
    *   The live preview pane **must** be implemented using a standard `tkinter.Text` widget.
    *   **Do not use any external HTML rendering libraries** like `tkhtmlview` or `WebView`.
    *   The preview should be generated by manually parsing the markdown text from the editor. Use basic string manipulation and regular expressions (`re` module) to identify markdown syntax (e.g., headings, bold, italic, code blocks).
    *   Apply styling to the preview text using `tkinter`'s `tag_configure` method.

### **UI and Styling Requirements**

1.  **Layout:**
    *   A two-pane window created with `tkinter.PanedWindow`.
    *   The left pane is the text editor.
    *   The right pane is the live preview.

2.  **Theme (Modern Dark):**
    *   **Background:** `#2b2b2b`
    *   **Editor Background:** `#3c3f41`
    *   **Text Color:** `#a9b7c6`
    *   **Heading Color:** `#61afef`
    *   **Code Block Background:** `#45494c`
    *   **Font:** Use a clean, monospaced font like `Consolas` at a readable size (e.g., 14).

### **Functional Requirements**

1.  **Live Preview:** The preview pane must update in real-time as the user types in the editor.

2.  **File Menu:** Implement a menu bar with the following `File` options:
    *   `New`: Clears the editor for a new document.
    *   `Open`: Opens a file dialog to load an existing `.md` file.
    *   `Save`: Saves the current document. If it's a new file, it should behave like `Save As`.
    *   `Save As...`: Opens a file dialog to save the document to a new location.
    *   `Exit`: Quits the application.

3.  **Unsaved Changes Prompt:** Before creating a new file, opening another, or exiting, the application must check for unsaved changes. If there are any, it must display a `messagebox` asking the user if they want to save their work (`Yes`/`No`/`Cancel`).

4.  **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Implement the following standard shortcuts:
    *   `Ctrl+N` for New
    *   `Ctrl+O` for Open
    *   `Ctrl+S` for Save
    *   `Ctrl+Shift+S` for Save As

5.  **Window Behavior:** On startup, the application window must be forced to the foreground to ensure it is visible to the user.

### **Final Deliverables**

In addition to the main application file (`main.py`), please also provide the following supporting files:

1.  **`requirements.txt`**: This file should be included, but it can be empty as there are no external dependencies.
2.  **`README.md`**: A comprehensive guide explaining the project's features, installation, and usage.
3.  **`.gitignore`**: A standard Python `.gitignore` file.
4.  **`run.sh`** and **`run.bat`**: Cross-platform scripts to easily install dependencies and launch the application.
